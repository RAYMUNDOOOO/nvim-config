Hi people, this is my config for Neovim. Feel free to use it but it's pretty basic, it contains:

## LSP Support
- lsp-zero (https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim) - A fantastic way to implement LSP support with snippets quick and easy
- nvim-lspconfig (https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) - Necessary for enabling LSP support
- mason and mason-lspconfig (https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim & https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) - Package manager for LSPs and more
